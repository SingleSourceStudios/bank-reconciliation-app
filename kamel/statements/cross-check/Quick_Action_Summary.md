**Good News:** Your actual transaction data is accurate and matches the bank statement well!

**Bad News:** Every transaction appears 3 times in your system (causing confusion).

---

## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ CLEAN UP DUPLICATES (15 minutes)

**The Problem:**
- Every transaction has 3 copies
- 1 marked "Reconciled" ‚úÖ
- 2 marked "Deleted" ‚ùå

**The Solution:**
Delete all entries with status "DeletedTransaction has been deleted"

**How To Do It in Xero:**
1. Go to: Accounting ‚Üí Bank Accounts ‚Üí Current Account
2. Click on "Reconcile" tab
3. Filter: Date range = Jan 1-31, 2025
4. Look for transactions showing "Deleted" status
5. Select all deleted transactions
6. Permanently delete them

**Expected Result:** Remove ~300-400 duplicate rows, keep ~150-200 valid transactions

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ RESOLVE UNRECONCILED ITEM (30 minutes investigation)

**The Transaction:**
- **Date:** January 9, 2025
- **Description:** Browib Hcc11799 57230001003
- **Amount:** R29,670.10 (CREDIT - money received)
- **Status:** UNRECONCILED

**What You Need To Do:**
1. Search Xero for customer "Browib"
2. Check your POS sales for January 9, 2025
3. Determine what this payment was for:
   - Is it a customer payment?

   - Is it something else?

**Then:**
- Create matching sales entry, OR

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ VERIFY SMALL TRANSACTIONS (10 minutes)

## üìä THE NUMBERS

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total CSV Rows** | ~450-600 |
| **Actual Unique Transactions** | ~150-200 |
| **Duplicate Rows to Delete** | ~300-400 |
| **Reconciled Correctly** | ~150 |
| **Unreconciled** | 1 (R29,670.10) |
| **Reconciliation Rate** | 99.3% |

---

## üîç HOW THIS HAPPENED

**Most Likely Cause:** Bank statement was imported 3 separate times
- Import #1 ‚Üí Transactions created
- Import #2 ‚Üí Duplicates created (marked as deleted)
- Import #3 ‚Üí More duplicates created (marked as deleted)

**Result:** Triple entries for everything

**Prevention:** Only import each bank statement ONCE, or use automatic bank feed (not both)

---

## üìù COMPARISON: CSV vs BANK STATEMENT

### Your CSV Shows (End of Month):

**31 January 2025:**
- Debits: R60,462.16 (15 transactions)
- Credits: R7,883.10 (2 transactions)

**30 January 2025:**
- Debits: R1,500.00 (3 transactions)
- Credits: R55,124.00 (2 transactions)

### Bank Statement Shows:
**Same amounts and transactions** ‚úÖ
