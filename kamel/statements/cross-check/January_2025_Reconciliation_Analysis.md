## ‚ö†Ô∏è DETAILED PROBLEM ANALYSIS

### Problem 1: Triple Entry Issue

Every transaction in your CSV appears exactly **3 times**:

**Example - 31 Jan 2025, Digital Payment to D Mpp for R21,500.00:**
```
Row 1: Status = "Reconciled"  ‚úÖ
Row 2: Status = "DeletedTransaction has been deleted"  ‚ùå
Row 3: Status = "DeletedTransaction has been deleted"  ‚ùå
```

**Impact:**
- Makes data analysis confusing
- Risk of counting transactions multiple times
- Suggests data was imported 3 separate times into Xero

**Recommendation:**
- Filter CSV to ONLY show "Reconciled" status
- Delete duplicate "Deleted" entries from Xero
- Investigate why imports happened multiple times

---

### Problem 2: Unreconciled Transaction

**Transaction Details:**
- **Date:** 9 January 2025
- **Type:** Credit
- **Description:** Acb Credit Browib Hcc11799 57230001003
- **Amount:** R29,670.10
- **Status:** UNRECONCILED

**Possible Reasons:**
1. Missing sales invoice or receipt in Xero
2. POS sales not yet recorded for that day
3. Bulk customer payment not yet allocated
4. Legitimate unmatched payment requiring investigation

**Action Required:**
- Check POS sales records for January 9, 2025
- Verify if this relates to a specific customer (Browib)
- Create matching sales entry if it's a valid income transaction
- Investigate if it's a transfer or refund
