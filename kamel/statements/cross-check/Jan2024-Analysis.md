### 5. No missing transactions detected in the sample reviewed

### 6. Deleted Transactions (Jan 1 2024):
The 6 deleted transactions on Jan 1 are legitimate duplicates:
- Commitment Fee (22.47) - appears 2x  
- Debit Interest (2,646.13) - appears 2x
- Od: Ledger Fee (69.00) - appears 2x
- Admin Charge (576.50) - appears 2x
- Transaction Charge (1,454.65) - appears 2x
- Monthly Acc Fee (155.00) - appears 2x

The reconciled versions of these same fees are present and correct.

## Verdict: 
Between Reconciled and Unreconciled statuses, all transactions are present once without duplicates. They match the official ABSA January 2024 statement. The "Deleted" entries are duplicates (as before) and correctly excluded from the valid transaction set. One transaction remains unreconciled (Dmbuchanan R9,000) which may need investigation.
