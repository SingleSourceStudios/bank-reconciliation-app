#### Mystery Payments Needing Investigation
1. **ACB Credit entries** - Appear regularly, varying amounts
2. **Spar River/La Lucia B** - R2,000-4,000 recurring
3. **Vodacom references** - Multiple small payments
4. **Settlement entries** - Generic, need specific customer links

## Recommended Reconciliation Process

### Step 1: Data Preparation (Day 1-2)

1. **Export all bank statements to Excel**
   - Columns: Date, Description, Reference, Debit, Credit, Balance
   - Clean data: Remove duplicates, fix formatting

2. **Export POS sales data**
   - Daily sales summaries
   - Individual transaction logs if available
   - Payment method breakdowns

3. **Create matching template**
   ```
   Date | Bank Amount | Bank Ref | POS Amount | Customer | Status | Notes
   ```

### Step 2: Automated Matching (Day 3-4)

**Python Script Framework:**
```python
# Key matching rules to implement:
1. Exact amount match within 2-day window
2. Reference text pattern matching (fuzzy logic)
3. Card number last 4 digits extraction
4. Regular customer pattern recognition
5. Round amount identification (likely invoice payments)
```

### Step 3: Manual Review Process (Day 5-7)

#### Priority Matches to Confirm
1. **All payments over R10,000** - Major customers
2. **Recurring monthly amounts** - Contract customers
3. **Round numbers** (R20,000, R5,000) - Invoice settlements
4. **Card clusters** - Same card, multiple daily transactions

#### Investigation Required
- Contact customers for payment confirmations
- Cross-reference with invoice numbers
- Check delivery records for timing matches

## Customer Identification Enhancement

### Immediate Actions

1. **Create Customer Database**
   ```
   Customer ID | Name | Card Numbers | Bank Ref | Avg Transaction | Frequency
   ```

2. **Pattern Recognition Rules**
   - Egg Designs: Look for "Egg" in reference
   - African Paper: "African", "Paper", round R20,000 amounts
   - Vegmore: Multiple small transactions, cards 2676/2702
   - Digital payments: Match amounts to invoices

3. **Missing Customer Investigation**
   - Art Culture Alliance - Last payment date?
   - Mathnwu Pottery - Contact details?
   - Roti and Chai - Payment pattern?

## Technology Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Quick Wins
1. **Excel Macro for Basic Matching**
   - VLOOKUP for exact amounts
   - Text search for customer names
   - Date range matching

2. **Bank Statement Parser**
   - PDF to CSV converter
   - Standardize formats
   - Clean reference fields

### Week 2: Advanced Matching
1. **Database Setup**
   - Customer master table
   - Transaction history table
   - Payment method mapping

2. **Matching Algorithm**
   - Implement fuzzy matching
   - Machine learning for patterns
   - Confidence scoring system

### Week 3: Reporting System
1. **Dashboard Creation**
   - Matched vs unmatched percentages
   - Customer payment trends
   - Outstanding reconciliation items

2. **Alert System**
   - Large unmatched deposits
   - Missing regular payments
   - Unusual transaction patterns
