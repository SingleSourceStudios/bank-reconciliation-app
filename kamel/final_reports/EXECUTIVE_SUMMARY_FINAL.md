## MEMO ENTRY ADJUSTMENTS EXPLAINED

### What Are Memo Entries?
Memo entries are adjustments we make for analysis purposes without changing the actual accounting records. They help us understand the true economic performance of the business.

### Owner A Drawings - R1,415,856
These are personal expenses that were run through the business:
- Entertainment: R383,676
- Personal Travel: R421,032  
- Personal Vehicle: R289,872
- Home Office: R197,964
- Other Personal: R123,312

**Impact:** These are added back to profit because a new owner won't have these expenses.

### FinFloot Rental Income - R1,141,451
This is rental income from a property that:
- Is NOT included in the business sale
- Stays with the current owner
- Won't generate income for the buyer

**Impact:** This is removed from revenue because the buyer won't receive this income.
