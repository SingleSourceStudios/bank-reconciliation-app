## NOTES FOR BUYER

1. **Normalized P&L represents actual transferable business operations**
   - Excludes rental income from property not included in sale
   - Removes personal expenses specific to current owner
   - Shows true operational profitability
2. **Key Risks Identified**
   - Low operational margins (7.9% net)
   - Heavy reliance on rental income in current structure
   - Customer concentration (93% from 3 customers)
   - Seasonal purchasing patterns (Q4 heavy)

3. **Working Capital Considerations**
   - VAT Payable: R560,000
   - Owner Drawings YTD: R1,294,230
   - Cash Position: R652,074

4. **Required Due Diligence**
   - Verify Q4 2024 sales to confirm seasonality claims
   - Interview major customers about future orders
   - Review all cost reduction opportunities
   - Negotiate property lease terms separately

*This comparison clearly shows the business generates minimal profit from operations alone.*
*Rental income has been subsidizing operational losses/low margins.*
