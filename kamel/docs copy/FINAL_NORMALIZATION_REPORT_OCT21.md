## VALUATION IMPLICATIONS

### Original vs Normalized
| Metric | Original | Normalized | Impact |
|--------|----------|------------|---------|
| Annual EBITDA | R2,957,408 | R494,059 | -83% |
| Valuation @ 4.3x | R12,716,855 | R2,124,454 | -R10.6M |
| Valuation @ 5.0x | R14,787,040 | R2,470,295 | -R12.3M |

**Critical Note:** The dramatic reduction reflects:
1. Rental income (R1.52M) from property NOT included in sale
2. Personal expenses (R1.42M) that buyer won't incur
3. True operational profitability is minimal

## RECONCILIATION BRIDGE

| Description | Annual Amount (R) |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Reported EBITDA (Original Calc)** | **2,957,408** |
| Less: Rental Income (not in sale) | (1,521,935) |
| Less: Overstatement of add-backs* | (941,414) |
| **True Operational EBITDA** | **494,059** |

*Original calculation added back R1,415,858 but expenses were already inflated by personal items

## RECOMMENDATION

**The business valuation should be based on R494,059 normalized EBITDA**, not the original R2.96M calculation. This represents:
- Actual operational performance
- Sustainable earnings for buyer
- Excludes non-transferable income streams
- Removes owner-specific expenses

**Suggested Valuation Range:** R1.5M - R2.5M (3-5x normalized EBITDA)

This is substantially lower than the original R11-14M estimate but reflects the true transferable business value.
