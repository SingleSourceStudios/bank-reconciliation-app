   - These are legitimate add-backs for valuation
   - New owner will not incur these expenses

3. **Working Capital:**
   - Additional analysis required for inventory levels
   - Cash conversion cycle assessment needed
   - Separate working capital adjustment may apply

4. **Sustainability:**
   - Core business generates R1,690,531 in revenue
   - 15.3% normalized EBITDA margin
   - Interest expense of R247,338 may be restructured
