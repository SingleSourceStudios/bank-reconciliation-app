## REVISED VALUATION FRAMEWORK

**Previous Estimate:** R2,957,408 (-83%)

### Valuation Scenarios

| Scenario | Multiple | Value | Assumptions |
|----------|----------|-------|-------------|

| **Conservative** | 3.0x | R1,482,180 | Verified seasonality |
| **Base Case** | 4.0x | R1,976,240 | Customer retention |
| **Optimistic** | 5.0x | R2,470,300 | Growth potential |

### Key Value Drivers

2. Lease terms on property
3. Working capital adjustments
4. Seller financing terms

## NEGOTIATION STRATEGY

### For Seller
**Reality Check Required:**
- Business barely profitable without rental income
- Original R11-14M valuation unrealistic
- Consider seller financing to bridge gap
### For Buyer
**Leverage Points:**
- Minimal operational profit
- Customer concentration risk
- Required working capital
- Property lease needed

**Offer Structure Suggestion:**
- Base price: R1.5M
- Earnout: Up to R500k based on customer retention
- Seller financing: 30% over 2 years
- Working capital adjustment
