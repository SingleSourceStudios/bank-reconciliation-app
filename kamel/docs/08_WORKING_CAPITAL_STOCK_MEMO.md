## CONCLUSION

The R300,000 stock value is **additional** to the enterprise valuation based on EBITDA. This represents normal operating inventory levels and should transfer at cost.

**Recommended Total Transaction Value: R2.4-2.6M**
- Enterprise Value: R2.1-2.3M
- Stock: R300,000

This maintains the integrity of the EBITDA-based valuation while properly accounting for working capital assets.
