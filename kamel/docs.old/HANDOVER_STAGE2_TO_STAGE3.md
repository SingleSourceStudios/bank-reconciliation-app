## üö® CRITICAL NOTES

### Xero MCP Server Status
‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Issue**: Xero MCP server may not be connected
- **Workaround**: Use Xero web interface for manual entry
- **Alternative**: Reconnect MCP server before execution
- **Test First**: Verify connection in Phase 3A

### Context Window Management
üî• **Important**: Stage 3 execution may require multiple chat sessions
- Work in phases (3A, 3B, 3C, 3D, 3E)
- Create sub-handovers if needed
- Don't try to complete everything in one chat
- Use the quick start template above for continuity

### Data Validation
‚úÖ **Always Verify**:
- Rental income R1,512,000 (not R175,000 - different figure)
- Personal expenses R1,415,856 (from Stage 1)
- Total normalization R2,927,856
- Account codes match specifications exactly

### User Communication
üí¨ **Keep User Informed**:
- Show progress at each phase
- Request approval before posting
- Explain normalization impact clearly
- Provide professional buyer-facing documentation
