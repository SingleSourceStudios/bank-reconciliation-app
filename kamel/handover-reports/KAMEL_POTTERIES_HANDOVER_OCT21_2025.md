## üìä CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION - UPDATED RISK ASSESSMENT

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PREVIOUS CONCERN (Now Clarified)
**Initial Finding:** 93.3% wholesale revenue from 3 customers appeared high-risk:
- African Paper Products: R178,777 (41%)
- Vegmore Distribution: R177,950 (41%)
- Egg Designs: R49,000 (11%)

**Apparent Customer Loss:** Egg Designs down 88.7% (R435k ‚Üí R49k)

### ‚úÖ ACTUAL SITUATION (Per Owner Clarification - Oct 21, 2025)
**"Egg Designs is still an ongoing and good client as well as some of the smaller ones who have not yet bought anything in 2025, as most do majority or all of their purchases in the 4th quarter."**

**Risk Mitigation Factors:**
1. **Q4 Seasonal Purchasing Pattern** - Normal business cycle, not customer loss
2. Egg Designs remains active client with established relationship
3. Smaller customers also follow Q4 purchasing pattern
4. 2024 Q4 baseline: Need to verify via Xero transaction data

**Action Required:** Pull Q4 2024 Xero transactions to confirm seasonal revenue spike and validate customer retention.

**Revised Risk Level:** Medium (down from High) - pending Q4 pattern verification

| Owner Drawings (9mo 2025) | 1,294,230 | R143,803/mo avg |

| **Actual Equity Movement** | Need BS data | To be extracted from Xero |

**Required:** Pull 2024 Dec and 2025 Sep Balance Sheets from Xero to verify:
1. Opening equity position
2. Retained earnings movement
3. Owner equity account changes
4. Reconcile to cash flow

### Cash Flow Indicators
- **Cash Position Sep 2025:** R652,074
- **Owner Drawings:** R1.29M (9 months)
- **Net Profit:** R1.13M (9 months)
- **Implies:** Business generated ~R2.42M cash or had opening cash balance

**Action:** Extract bank account movements from Xero to verify cash generation vs drawings.

## üìã BUYER PRESENTATION - KEY TALKING POINTS

### Strengths to Emphasize
1. **Market Dominance:** 33% market share in fragmented industry
2. **Dual Revenue Streams:** 52% sales + 47% rental (diversification)
3. **High Margins:** 75% gross margin, 46% net margin (very strong)
4. **Established Brand:** "Foremost supplier in South Africa" - 17 years
5. **Recurring Rental Base:** R1.14M annual passive income
6. **Strategic Location:** 11.8km from CBD (better than 17.2km market avg)
7. **Recent Capex:** R469k invested in 2025 (shows business confidence)
8. **Strong Cash Generation:** R652k cash despite R1.29M owner drawings
9. **Minimal Debt:** Only R68k loan (low leverage opportunity)
10. **Sticky Customers:** Long-term wholesale relationships

### Risks to Address Proactively
1. **Customer Concentration (Mitigated):**
   - 93% from 3 customers BUT seasonal Q4 purchasing pattern
   - Historical relationships (need to verify length)
   - Contractual terms (need to review)
   
2. **Revenue Reconciliation Gap:**
   - R831k unexplained sales in 2025 (66% of reported)
   - Need POS system audit and bank statement verification
   - May indicate undocumented cash sales (positive for valuation if verified)

3. **Wholesale Decline Trend:**
   - Appears as 70% decline but explained by Q4 seasonality
   - Requires Q4 2024 Xero data to confirm pattern
   - If confirmed, removes major red flag

4. **Property Structure Unclear:**
   - R18,842/mo bond in add-backs needs explanation
   - Rental income tenant identification required
   - Lease vs purchase decision for buyer

5. **Regional Market Focus:**
   - Durban-centric operations
   - Limited national expansion (opportunity or constraint?)
   - KZN strong craft market but geographically limited

### Negotiation Leverage Points
**For Buyer:**
- Customer concentration requires retention agreements
- Sales reconciliation discrepancies (due diligence risk)
- Property/lease structure uncertainty
- Working capital adjustment (VAT payable R560k)

**For Seller:**
- Dominant market position (hard to replicate)
- Proven profitability with owner add-backs
- Strategic real estate (rental income stream)
- Recent capex reduces buyer's initial investment needs
- Strong cash generation despite high drawings
